   - `adb.exe`
   - `AdbWinApi.dll`
   - `AdbWinUsbApi.dll`

4. The application will automatically detect and use ADB from the `adb` folder

## Building and Running

```bash
# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the application
dotnet run
```

Or build a release version:

```bash

```

## Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Limitations**:

- **Root Access**: Full recovery of deleted files requires root access on your Android device
- **Without Root**: The tool can only recover files that are still accessible through normal file system operations
- **Deleted Files**: Truly deleted files (overwritten by the system) may not be recoverable without root access
- **Storage Access**: The tool scans the specified storage path (default: /sdcard)

## Troubleshooting

### ADB Not Found
- Ensure ADB files are placed in the `adb` folder
- Run the `download-adb.ps1` script to automatically setup ADB
- Check that `adb.exe`, `AdbWinApi.dll`, and `AdbWinUsbApi.dll` are all present

### Device Not Detected
- Ensure USB debugging is enabled on your device
- Check USB cable connection
- Try different USB ports
- Verify device drivers are installed
- Make sure you authorize the computer when prompted on your device

### No Files Found
- Ensure you've selected at least one file type
- Verify the storage path is correct (try `/sdcard` or `/storage/emulated/0`)
- Check if device has root access for deleted file recovery

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: .NET 9.0
- **UI**: WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- **Architecture**: Service-based with separation of concerns
- **ADB Integration**: Uses bundled ADB from project folder, falls back to system-wide installation
